# 🔧 Fixing OpenAI API Quota Issue

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Your chatbot is showing fallback responses because the **OpenAI API quota has been exceeded**. The error message you're seeing is actually the intended fallback behavior working correctly!

```
❌ Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details
```

## 💡 Why This Happens

The OpenAI API has usage limits based on your account type:
- **Free tier**: Limited credits that can be quickly exhausted
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Requires adding credits to your account
- **Usage limits**: Daily/monthly quotas that reset over time

## 🛠️ Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Add Credits to OpenAI Account
1. **Visit**: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Login** with your OpenAI account
3. **Add credits** to your account (minimum $5)
4. **Test the chatbot** - it should work immediately

### Option 2: Wait for Quota Reset
- **Free tier**: Quotas typically reset monthly
- **Check your usage**: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
- **Monitor limits**: See when your quota resets

### Option 3: Use a Different API Key
1. **Create new OpenAI account** if you have exhausted your free tier
2. **Generate new API key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. **Update `.env.local`** with the new key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```
4. **Restart your development server**

## ✅ Verify the Fix
