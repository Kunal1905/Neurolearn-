## 🧠 Brain Dominance Features Preserved

The brain dominance adaptation system is fully functional with Gemini API:

- **Left-brain users** (temperature: 0.6): Structured, analytical responses
- **Right-brain users** (temperature: 0.9): Creative, intuitive responses  
- **Balanced users** (temperature: 0.8): Well-rounded, adaptive responses
